# Multi_Level_Feedback_Queue
Multi Level Feedback Queue scheduling uses a feedback mechanism to adjust the priority of a process based on its behavior over time. For example, if a process in a lower-priority queue uses up its time slice, it may be moved to a higher-priority queue to ensure it gets more CPU time.
